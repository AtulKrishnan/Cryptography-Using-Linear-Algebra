# Cryptography-Using-Linear-Algebra

Hey Everyone!
In this fun and interesting project, we have made the process of Encryption and Decryption of Text files easy and simple!

#Getting Started
1. Download the encrypt_cryptography.py file
2. Download the decrypt_cryptography.py file
3. Download the secret.txt file or make your own secret.txt file!

Place all the files in the same folder and run the encryption code. This performs a series of multiple matrix transformations before providing us another file contaiing the encrypted text of only numbers.
To get back the original file, we can similarly run the decryption code and all the reverse calculations are performed.

For now only the letters present in the dictionary will work. This can be improved by adding more characters in the dictionary and assigning them numbers. But keep note that a suitable encryption matrix and its inverse must also be selected to make sure all calculations happen correctly.

We hope you love the project and have a good time playing with it!
